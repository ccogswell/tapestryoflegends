He was arrogant, convinced of his own intellectual superiority. He believed he could pose a question to a powerful fiend and compel a truthful answer without offering anything in return. He saw it as an experiment, a way to verify his research and unlock secrets no other mortal had ever accessed.

In the sound-proofed security of his private study, he inscribed a complex, theoretical summoning diagram—not for binding, but for communication. He spoke the reconstructed phrase. The air did not grow cold, nor did the room fill with smoke. Instead, a voice answered, not in the room, but inside his head. It was calm, articulate, and terrifyingly intelligent.

It was the voice of a Pit Fiend, a general from the Nine Hells. The fiend was amused by Malachi's attempt, praising his intellect before pointing out the subtle, critical flaw in his translation. The ""universal syntax"" wasn't a tool for compelling answers; it was an invitation to bargain, with the speaker's soul as the automatic wager.
